**!You need everything from the collection Slashers Extended for everything to work and show properly!**

**!Original gamemode can conflict with this version!**

BtD is an revamped version of Slashers gamemode from Utopia Games.

The former devs abandoned the gamemode. But I really wanted to revive the gamemode and improve it.

The content of this version is huge, I'll promise you will have fun!

## Features:
- Any map can have any killer! I've added F4 menu which allows player to choose which killer he wants to play, also featuring a preview of the model and description of the killer (stats + abilities if any)
- A huge amount of killers have abilities, new survivors also have triggerable abilities
- I've adapted and will (probably) adapt more maps for this gamemode (See Official Maps)
- Some killers (currently only Slenderman) have an unique mode for the round, changing the pace of the game and the objectives
- Gamemode features ulx commands for administration (See Official Addons)
- Some killers have voiceovers that trigger when starting the chase
- Custom round ambient + end round music for killers (Example: Slenderman)
- And much more!
