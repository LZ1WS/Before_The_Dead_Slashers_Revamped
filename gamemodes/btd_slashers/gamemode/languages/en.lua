LANG["class_desc_wesker"] = "Every day, mankind edges closer to self-destruction. I'm not destroying the world, I'm saving it!\nYou are Albert Wesker, bearer of Uroboros.

LANG["class_desc_scrake"] = "A two-meter Horzine monster, the embodiment of rage and steel. Your built-in chainsaw tears through flesh, and a swift charge (Q) plows through everything in its path.
